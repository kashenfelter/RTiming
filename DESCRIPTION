Package: RTiming
Title: Timing test code for some aspects of the R interpreter
Description:  This package is a start to collect some tests
 for various aspects of the R interpreter such as the need to
 duplicate/copy objects, how expensive it is to have code that conditionally
 casts rather than first coerce to the target type, and so on.
 The intent is to be able to run the tests and get the timings easily
 on various different machines, platforms, optimization specifications, etc.
